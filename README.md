Mandexing source

Mandexing allows you to manually index, load and save rotation matrices for crystals and rotate them within the GUI.
This is also likely to be a good teaching tool.

Installation instructions are lacking.

Binary files will be available at some point, probably. Check 'Releases'.

Contact me if you need.
